There are two ways to do this problem. One observation is to convert the number to base 10, multiply by 17, and then convert to base 2 again. We can also conceptually notice that 

                                                17N = 16N + N
                                                
where N is the input number. We see that in binary, 16N is the original number N followed by 4 trailing zeros. Once we add this to the original number, we will have the answer.
