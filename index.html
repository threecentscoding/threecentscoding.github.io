  <p>Hey! Welcome to our "website" on the "internet"!</p>
  <p>Who are we? We're ThreeCents: a little more than two cents but less than four. We like programming, and decided to share some of the good vibes. We've made Java tutorials and some games, and we'll publish some solutions to competitive programming questions too.</p>
  <p>Here are the devs behind it!</p>

  <p>Ritvik Teegavarapu is a high school sophomore. He only recently became very interested in computer science, after taking a full year Introduction to Java course. After finding his passion, he avidly worked to learn more about Java, as well as learning new languages along the way, such as Python and C++. He now focuses his time on competitive programming, specifically, the United States Computing Olympiad. He's in charge of that part of the site.</p>
