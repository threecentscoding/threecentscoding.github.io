  <p>Hey! Welcome to our "website" on the "internet"!</p>
  <br>
  <p>Who are we? We're ThreeCents: a little more than two cents but less than four. We like programming, and decided to share some of the good vibes. We've made Java tutorials and some games, and we'll publish some solutions to Computing Olympiad questions too.</p>
